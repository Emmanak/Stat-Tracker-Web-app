# Stat-Tracker-Web-app
This web app is used to keep track of realtime gospel stats. It requires a database to store collected stats

<h3> Important </h3>
First and foremost - this app needs to be hosted on a webserver. I recommend 000webhost.com since they offer free hosting. They also provide 2 Databases for free. You will need to create a database to make this app functional. Otherwise it will require a query error. 

Database requres 3 fields.
  "bibles" to store number of bibles
  "tracts" to store number of tracts
  "contacted" to store number of contacted.
  
  The links to the purple button sign-up forms can be change in the HTML code. 
  Individual Stats is my personal google forms sign-up for information about the contacted individual. 
  These links can all be changed to your own form sign-ups
